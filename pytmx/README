v.15 - for python 2.7

Tested with Tiled 0.8.0 for Mac.

released under the LGPL v3


===============================================================================

This map loader can be used to load maps created in the Tiled map editor.  It
provides a simple way to get tiles and associated metadata so that you can draw
a map onto the screen.

This is *not* a rendering engine.  It will load the data that is necessary to
render a map onto the screen.  All tiles will be loaded into in memory and
available to blit onto the screen.


Design Goals:
    Simple api
    Memory efficient and fast

Features:
    Loads data and "properties" metadata from Tile's TMX format
    "Properties" for: maps, tilesets, layers, objectgroups, objects, and tiles
    Point data for polygon and polyline objects
    Automatic flipping and rotation of tiles
    Supports base64, csv, gzip, zlib and uncompressed XML
    Image loading with pygame


===============================================================================

Please see tmxloader.py's docstring for version information and sample usage.
Check tests/test.py and tests/demo.py for examples on how to use the library.
